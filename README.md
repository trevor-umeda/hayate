# Hayatebot

A [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) bot that does goofy things.

## To run
`node hayate.js`

### Reactions

Will post user entered reaction images. Due to the magic of discord hayate can just post
links and discord will handle the rendering of them. Thus we don't have to worry about uploading
them anywhere.

Hayate will pull from a grails service hosted on heroku to get a random image that fits a "tag"

### Twitch?
